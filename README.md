## How To Run
```
python3 webProxyCache.py localhost
```
## Disclaimers
Important things to point out for our program is that we ran using http://localhost:8888/[website] rather than configuring our browser to run through our proxy. We tested in Firefox.  
EX: http://localhost:8888/www.apache.org.

If for any reason a request may not work, attempt to rerun with or without the “www.” portion of the address depending on if you included it.
Sometimes just simply reruning can also help. 

The sites that we used for our testing and are confirmed to have worked are 
http://localhost:8888/www.apache.org
http://localhost:8888/gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/HTTP-wireshark-file2.html
http://localhost:8888/www.example.com
http://localhost:8888/www.washington.edu/
